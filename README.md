# Client Project

This exercise is about client communication and planning. You'll learn to use new design tools, plan your work to save development time (though there won't be any coding on this project), and communicate user stories through UML diagrams.

## Learning Objectives
- Define the clientâ€™s needs
- Scope the project
- Define User functionalities (login, logout, delete, ...)
- Prepare a UML diagram (for both navigations and actions)
- Prepare a wireframe of the website with for example balsamiq
- Prepare a moqup of the website using a design tool such as Figma
- Communicate the endresult with the client
- Add a quality readme

### Client needs (user stories)

## Briefing
Choose for one of the following clients you'll prepare a website for.

### OlaFresco
OlaFresco needs a website for meal orders

#### Client demands :

- The landing page explains the service
- A member section to choose meals
- A member section to keep track of their orders
- An admin section to manage meal deliveries
